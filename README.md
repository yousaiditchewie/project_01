# ![](../../resources/assets/ga-icon-small.png) Client-side Game

### Overview

Let's start out with something fun - **a game!**

Everyone will get a chance to **be creative**, and work through some really
**tough programming challenges** – since you've already gotten your feet wet
with Tic-Tac-Toe, it's up to you to come up with a fun and interesting game
to build.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding
you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!

As a reminder, your project's code **must be substantially yours**. Do not copy code from other similar projects. However, relying on techniques and a line of code here and there found on StackOverflow is okay.

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

- **Render a game in the browser**
- **Code win logic and display on screen when game is won**
- **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
- Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and
  **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
- Use **Javascript or jQuery** for **DOM manipulation**
- **Deploy your game online**, using GitHub Pages, where the rest of the world can access it
- Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

Niceties:

- **Make a two player game.** Switch turns between two players and display which player won.

### Necessary Deliverables

**In order of importance:**

- A set of User Stories (or features) that describe your game, in the following
  categories:
  1. MVP,
    - Completed
    - Ongoing
  2. Icebox.
- **A ``readme.md`` file** with:
  1. a description of your game (***[Use Your Game's Name]***)
  2. lists and explanations of the technologies used (**Technologies**),
  3. the design approach taken (**Design**),
  4. installation instructions (**Get Started**), and
  5. unsolved problems and/or planned features (**Next Steps**).
- The code for **a working game, built by you**, hosted on GitHub,
  with frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project.
- The game, **hosted on the internet**, with a link to it provided in the URL
  section of your Github repo.

### Suggestions

- **Begin by wireframing and whiteboarding!** Think generally about how you'd
  like your game to work.
- **Frame the users' interaction with the game in terms of User Stories.**
- **Break the User Stories down into different components** (data,
  presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component
  individually. Use whiteboards!
- **Use your Development Tools** (`console.log`, inspector, `alert` statements,
  etc.) to debug and solve problems
- Work through the lessons in class and
  **[post GitHub Issues when you need to](../project_issues_protocol)**!
- **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because
  you can always go back in time to a previous version.
- **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, jQuery, etc.) to better understand
  what you’ll be getting into.
- **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.**
  Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real
  data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to
  change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose
  game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.

### Potential Project Ideas

##### Blackjack

Make a one player game where people down on their luck can lose all their money
by guessing which card the computer will deal next!

##### Concentration

Sometimes just called "Memory", it's a card game in which all of the cards are
laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn.
If you get all the matching cards, you've won!

##### Self-scoring Trivia

Test your wits & knowledge with whatever-the-heck you know about (so you can
actually win). Guess answers, have the computer tell you how right you are!

### Useful Resources

- **[MDN Javascript Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)**
  _(a great reference for all things Vanilla Javascript)_
- **[jQuery Docs](http://api.jquery.com)** _(if you're using jQuery)_
- **[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)** _(for hosting your game)_

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

- **Project Workflow**: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task
  tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as
  expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?
- **Technical Requirements**: Did you deliver a project that met all the
  technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you
  build something that was reasonably complex?
- **Creativity**: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your
  project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not
  just a login button and an index page)?
- **Code Quality**: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices
  covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you
  comment your code as your instructors have in class?
- **Problem Solving**: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution
  in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative
  implementations? _(Note that this part of your feedback evaluation will take
  place during your one-on-one code review with your instructors, after you've
  completed the project.)_
- **Total**: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project
  between:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Did not attempt, or completely inadequate_
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectactions, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

  This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project
  goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above,
  which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
